# web-test-manager
A web application to randomly select five (5) questions from a test generated and give them to a
student for answering. The student must be given one question at a time to answer. After all the questions 
have been answered, the web application is required to do two things, namely:
• Mark the work of the student.
• Display a summary report. The report should include the following information:
✓ The name of the student.
✓ The number of questions asked.
✓ The number of correct answers.
✓ The percentage mark obtained.
✓ The list of questions asked.
✓ The correct answer for each question.
✓ The answers provided by the student for each question.
✓ The marking outcome for each student answer (“Correct” or “Wrong”).
